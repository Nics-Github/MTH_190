However, if it suits your learning style better, please do read beforehand.\n* While you don't need to turn in your learning check answers, I *highly* recommend you still do them. The solutions are in Appendix D of the book.\n* If you have your headphones, you may listen to music during in-class reading time.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n# Lec 01: Fri 9/3 {#Lec01}\n\n## Announcements\n\nWelcome!\n\n## Today's topics/activities\n\n* Course webpage: bit.ly/sds192kim\n* My story\n* \"Knock on wood if you're with me\"\n* What this class is about: Answering questions with data\n    1.
